//|     PWM generator module for CSUS Senior Design
//|
//|     Author: David Larribas
//|
//|     This module generates a variable duty cycle PWM signal at about 370khz to
//|			control the bicycle's motor. It it parametized to include a variable offset
//|			that can adjust the floor of the modules response.
